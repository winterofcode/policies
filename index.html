                            <h5>Purpose</h5>
                            <p>A primary goal of Winter of Code is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment
                                for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof). This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community,
                                as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We invite all those who participate in Winter of Code to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Open Source Citizenship</h5>
                        </li>
                        <p>A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community. Communities mirror
                            the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society. If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community
                            is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

                            <h5>Expected Behavior</h5>

                            <li>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.</li>
                            <li>Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <h5>Weapons Policy</h5>
                        </li>
                        <p>No weapons will be allowed at Winter of Code events, community spaces, or in other spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct. Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives
                            such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only
                            be allowed to return without the weapon. Community members are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.</p>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h5>
                        </li>
                        <p>Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a community member
                            engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the
                            case of a paid event).
                        </p>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Reporting Guidelines</h5>
                        </li>
                        <p>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. Drop in a message at <a href="mailto:hello@winterofcode.com">hello@winterofcode.com</a>.
                            Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers
                            will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.
                        </p>
                        <li>
                            <h5>Addressing Grievances</h5>
                        </li>
                        <p>If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify DSC NSEC with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing
                            policies.

                            <h5>Scope</h5>
                        </li>
                        <p>We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining
                            to community business. This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety
                            and well-being of community members.
